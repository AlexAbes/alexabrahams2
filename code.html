					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education" target ="_blank">General Assembly</a> is a global technology education organisation with offices everywhere. They have full-time and part-time courses; classes are twice a week and last for 10 weeks. GA also do some free one-off sessions like their 'Intro to the London Startup Scene' class. Sign up to their mailing list for notifications about their classes and sessions.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.steer.me/" target ="_blank">Steer</a> is where you can do a 5-day immersive on a topic like iOS app development or basic HTML and CSS. They also have a great collection of <a href="http://resources.steer.me/iOS" target="_blank">resources available</a>on their site.I have done their iOS course and it was great, email me for more info!</li>
						<li>If you want to go really hardcore, <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target ="_blank">Maker's Academy</a> could be for you. It's a full-time 12 week course designed to take you from coding newbie to full-stack developer. I know someone who did just this, graduating from Oxford with a degree in PPE in 2013 and then did Maker's for 3 months. She is now a developer at a software agency.</li>
						<li> <a href="http://www.coderwave.com/" target ="_blank">Coderwave</a> do basic coding courses in West London. The founder, Rosario, did a really nice <a href="http://www.coderwave.com/wwc" target ="_blank">introduction to HTML, CSS and Ruby</a> for Women Who Code members recently.</li>
						<li> <a href="http://www.decoded.co/" target ="_blank">Decoded</a> promise to teach you how to code in a day. This is the perfect option if your company is offering to pay for it, or if you have close to £1000 in spare change. They have an online <a href="http://o2learn.decoded.co/html-css/lesson/0/" target ="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> to learning HTML and CSS for free, however. Kathryn Parsons is a cofounder and a general tech powerhouse of London.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>I use <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com/" target ="_blank">Team Treehouse</a> for learning to code online; it has a huge amount of content on everything from iOS and Android development to the web development I am into. I particularly enjoy the competitive side of comparing achievements in the leaderboard! Treehouse works well when you feel like you're never going to make a dent in the amount of stuff there is to learn- you can see exactly how far you are through a topic. Its $25 per month for a regular membership but for students its only $9. </li>
						<li>There’s also General Assembly’s <strong>free</strong> <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank"> Dash</a> platform which I used when I was just getting started. They offer something similar to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, but are much better at explaining things.</li>
						<li> <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/" target="_blank"> Don't Fear The Internet</a> have a series of video presentations on topics within basic HTML and CSS. I like their one on the difference between IDs and classes.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.techspot.com/article/753-learning-to-code-free/" target="_blank">TechSpot</a> has a list of mini-resources for learning particular areas like Android development, Python and other languages.</li>

						<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is your new best friend for getting pretty landing pages made quickly and easily. Its themes are designed to be perfectly responsive and mobile-first. Even better, <a href="http://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">Bootswatch</a> allows you to just add one line of code to the top of your HTML file to get access to ready-made CSS. I made this website for <a href="http://edenbaking.co.uk" target="_blank">Eden Bakery</a> using Bootswatch and found it easy to use and customise.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.cssbuttongenerator.com/" target="_blank">CSS Button Generator</a> is a quick tool for getting the right CSS for the button I want.</li>
						<li>Find what border radius value you actually want with the <a href="http://border-radius.com/" target="_blank">CSS Border Radius</a> generator.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp" target="_blank">This tool</a> will give you the color you want in terms of ##### values and <a href="http://hex2rgba.devoth.com/" target="_blank">this tool</a> will give you the color you want in Hex RGBA values.</li>
						<li>You know those little icons you see next to the name of a website on the browser tab? They're called <strong>favicons</strong> and you can make one for your own website at <a href="http://faviconit.com/en" target="_blank">FaviconIt</a>.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.google.com/fonts#ChoosePlace:select" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> gives you a wide range of fonts to choose from, and you can use one by adding just one line of code.</li>
						<li>If you're obssessed with having a website that's compatible across all browsers, you can use the <a href="http://www.browserstack.com/" target="_blank">Cross Browser Testing Tool</a> to check what your site looks like no matter what browser is being used.</li>
						<li><a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a> is a wonderful array of cool HTML, CSS and Javascript effects. They're freely available to copy and use for your own site.</li>
						<li>Eventually you may need an app to design webpages, and there's nothing better for that than <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>. It takes a little getting used to but once you have got the hang of it it is a really powerful tool for visualising your site.</li>
